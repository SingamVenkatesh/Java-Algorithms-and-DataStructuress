1. What is File Handling in Java?
File Handling in Java refers to the process of performing operations like creating,
reading, writing, updating, or deleting files using Java code. It allows interaction
 with files stored on the disk, making it possible to persist or retrieve data as needed.


âœ… 2. Which package is used for File Handling?
Java provides the java.io package for basic file handling operations.
Common classes from this package:

File

FileReader

FileWriter

BufferedReader

BufferedWriter

FileInputStream

FileOutputStream

âœ… 3. What is the difference between File, FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, and BufferedWriter?
Class	Purpose
File	Represents a file or directory. Used to create, delete, check existence, get file info.
FileReader	Used to read characters from a file (character stream).
FileWriter	Used to write characters to a file.
BufferedReader	Wraps FileReader for efficient line-by-line reading using readLine().
BufferedWriter	Wraps FileWriter for efficient writing (uses buffer).

BufferedReader and BufferedWriter improve performance by reducing disk I/O calls.

âœ… 4. How do you create a new file in Java?
java
Copy
Edit
import java.io.File;

File file = new File("example.txt");
if (file.createNewFile()) {
    System.out.println("File created.");
} else {
    System.out.println("File already exists.");
}
Use createNewFile() method of the File class.

âœ… 5. How can you check if a file exists or not?
java
Copy
Edit
File file = new File("example.txt");
if (file.exists()) {
    System.out.println("File exists.");
} else {
    System.out.println("File does not exist.");
}
Use file.exists() method.

âœ… 6. How do you write to a file in Java?
java
Copy
Edit
import java.io.FileWriter;

FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("example.txt");
writer.write("Hello, File!");
writer.close();
Use FileWriter or BufferedWriter to write content to a file.

âœ… 7. How do you read from a file character by character?
java
Copy
Edit
import java.io.FileReader;

FileReader reader = new FileReader("example.txt");
int ch;
while ((ch = reader.read()) != -1) {
    System.out.print((char) ch);
}
reader.close();
Use FileReader.read() in a loop to read characters one by one.

âœ… 8. How do you read a file line by line?
java
Copy
Edit
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;

BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("example.txt"));
String line;
while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
    System.out.println(line);
}
reader.close();
Use BufferedReader.readLine() for reading line by line.

âœ… 9. How do you append content to an existing file?
java
Copy
Edit
FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("example.txt", true);  // true = append mode
writer.write("New line appended.\n");
writer.close();
Pass true as the second argument in FileWriter constructor.

âœ… 10. What happens if you try to read a file that doesn't exist?
Java throws a FileNotFoundException, which is a checked exception.

You must handle it using try-catch, or declare throws IOException.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
try {
    FileReader reader = new FileReader("nonexistent.txt");
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
    System.out.println("File not found!");
}

âœ… 1. How do you delete a file using Java?
java
Copy
Edit
import java.io.File;

File file = new File("example.txt");
if (file.delete()) {
    System.out.println("File deleted successfully.");
} else {
    System.out.println("Failed to delete the file.");
}
Use file.delete() method.

Returns true if file is successfully deleted.

âœ… 2. How can you rename a file?
java
Copy
Edit
File oldFile = new File("old.txt");
File newFile = new File("new.txt");

if (oldFile.renameTo(newFile)) {
    System.out.println("File renamed successfully.");
} else {
    System.out.println("Failed to rename the file.");
}
Use renameTo() method of File class.

âœ… 3. What are BufferedReader and BufferedWriter? Why are they used?
BufferedReader reads text from a character-input stream efficiently, using a buffer.

BufferedWriter writes text to a character-output stream efficiently.

Benefits:

Faster than using FileReader/FileWriter alone because they use internal buffers.

BufferedReader provides readLine() method to read line-by-line.

âœ… 4. What's the difference between FileReader and BufferedReader?
Aspect	FileReader	BufferedReader
Speed	Slower (no buffer)	Faster (uses a buffer)
Line Reading	No readLine() method	Has readLine() method
Use Case	Small files	Large files or line-by-line reading

âœ… 5. Can we read and write to the same file simultaneously?
Technically yes, but it's not recommended because:

It can lead to data corruption or overwrite.

Java file writers/readers donâ€™t synchronize access.

ðŸ“Œ Best practice: Read into memory â†’ modify â†’ write back.

âœ… 6. How do you list all files in a directory?
java
Copy
Edit
File folder = new File("C:/MyFolder");
File[] files = folder.listFiles();

for (File file : files) {
    System.out.println(file.getName());
}
Use File.listFiles() or File.list() to get all files in a folder.

âœ… 7. What is the difference between read() and readLine()?
Method	Description	Returns
read()	Reads one character at a time	int
readLine()	Reads one line at a time	String

read() is used for character-by-character reading.

readLine() is better for reading line-by-line.

âœ… 8. How to read all lines from a file into a List? (Java 8+)
java
Copy
Edit
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.util.List;

List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get("example.txt"));
for (String line : lines) {
    System.out.println(line);
}
Use Files.readAllLines() from java.nio.file package.

âœ… 9. How do you count the number of lines or characters in a file?
ðŸ”¹ Count Lines:
java
Copy
Edit
BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("example.txt"));
int lineCount = 0;
while (reader.readLine() != null) {
    lineCount++;
}
reader.close();
ðŸ”¹ Count Characters:
java
Copy
Edit
FileReader reader = new FileReader("example.txt");
int charCount = 0;
while (reader.read() != -1) {
    charCount++;
}
reader.close();
âœ… 10. How do you copy contents from one file to another?
java
Copy
Edit
import java.io.*;

public class CopyFile {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("source.txt"));
        BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("target.txt"));

        String line;
        while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
            writer.write(line);
            writer.newLine();
        }

        reader.close();
        writer.close();
    }
}
Use BufferedReader and BufferedWriter to efficiently read and write.

Letâ€™s go one by one:

âœ… 1. How to read and reverse each line using StringBuffer?
java
Copy
Edit
BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("example.txt"));
String line;
while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
    StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(line);
    System.out.println(sb.reverse());
}
reader.close();
StringBuffer.reverse() reverses the content of each line.

âœ… 2. How to remove a specific line from a file?
java
Copy
Edit
BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("example.txt"));
List<String> lines = new ArrayList<>();
String lineToRemove = "MS Dhoni";
String line;
while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
    if (!line.equals(lineToRemove)) {
        lines.add(line);
    }
}
reader.close();

BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("example.txt"));
for (String l : lines) {
    writer.write(l);
    writer.newLine();
}
writer.close();
Reads all lines, skips the one you want to remove, and writes back the rest.

âœ… 3. How to replace a specific word in a file with another word?
java
Copy
Edit
BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("example.txt"));
List<String> lines = new ArrayList<>();
String line;
while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
    lines.add(line.replace("Kohli", "Sharma"));  // replace word
}
reader.close();

BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("example.txt"));
for (String l : lines) {
    writer.write(l);
    writer.newLine();
}
writer.close();
âœ… 4. How do you merge contents of two files into a third file?
java
Copy
Edit
BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("merged.txt"));

BufferedReader reader1 = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file1.txt"));
BufferedReader reader2 = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file2.txt"));

String line;
while ((line = reader1.readLine()) != null) {
    writer.write(line);
    writer.newLine();
}
reader1.close();

while ((line = reader2.readLine()) != null) {
    writer.write(line);
    writer.newLine();
}
reader2.close();
writer.close();
âœ… 5. How do you handle large files (e.g., 1 GB) efficiently in Java?
Use BufferedReader â€” processes file line-by-line.

Avoid reading the whole file into memory (readAllLines()).

Consider using:

FileChannel with ByteBuffer

Memory-mapped files

Streaming APIs

âœ… 6. What are FileInputStream and FileOutputStream used for?
Used for byte stream operations (binary files).

Example: Reading/writing images, audio, video, PDF, etc.

java
Copy
Edit
FileInputStream in = new FileInputStream("source.jpg");
FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream("target.jpg");
int b;
while ((b = in.read()) != -1) {
    out.write(b);
}
in.close();
out.close();
âœ… 7. Difference between character streams and byte streams?
Feature	Character Stream (Reader/Writer)	Byte Stream (InputStream/OutputStream)
Data type handled	Characters (text)	Bytes (binary data)
Suitable for	Text files	Images, audio, PDF
Classes used	FileReader, FileWriter	FileInputStream, FileOutputStream

âœ… 8. How do you store objects in a file? (Serialization)
java
Copy
Edit
ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("object.dat"));
oos.writeObject(myObject);
oos.close();

ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("object.dat"));
MyClass obj = (MyClass) ois.readObject();
ois.close();
The class must implement Serializable interface.

âœ… 9. How do you encrypt file content before saving?
Use a simple algorithm or javax.crypto APIs.

java
Copy
Edit
String content = "Secret";
String encrypted = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(content.getBytes());

FileWriter fw = new FileWriter("secret.txt");
fw.write(encrypted);
fw.close();
For real encryption: use AES with CipherOutputStream.

âœ… 10. How do you read a file using Scanner class?
java
Copy
Edit
Scanner sc = new Scanner(new File("example.txt"));
while (sc.hasNextLine()) {
    System.out.println(sc.nextLine());
}
sc.close();
Scanner is good for simple parsing and splitting based on regex.

âœ… 11. Whatâ€™s the use of mark() and reset() methods in BufferedReader?
mark(int limit) â†’ marks current position in stream.

reset() â†’ returns to the last marked position.

java
Copy
Edit
BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("example.txt"));
reader.mark(100);
System.out.println(reader.readLine());
reader.reset();  // Go back to previous mark
System.out.println(reader.readLine());
Useful for peeking ahead in streams without losing position.

âœ… 12. Explain how you would implement a log file system in Java.
Append logs using FileWriter in append mode.

Add timestamp and log level (INFO, ERROR).

Use SimpleDateFormat for formatting date.

java
Copy
Edit
FileWriter fw = new FileWriter("log.txt", true);
fw.write("[INFO] " + new Date() + " - Application Started\n");
fw.close();
âœ… 13. How do you handle exceptions when working with files?
Use:

try-catch-finally

or better: try-with-resources (auto closes)

java
Copy
Edit
try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("example.txt"))) {
    // File reading
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
